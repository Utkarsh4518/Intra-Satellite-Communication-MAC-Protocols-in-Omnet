# Trend indicator thresholds for post-processing (qualitative only).
# These are observational criteria for labeling regimes. They are NOT fitted,
# NOT extrapolated, and do NOT imply optimality. See TREND_INDICATORS.md.

# --- Observations (computed from scalars) ---
# No thresholds here; these are raw or aggregated metrics.

# --- Interpretation: latency unbounded ---
# When max E2EDelayMax over nodes exceeds this (seconds), we label as high latency.
# Chosen as a multiple of typical packet interval; not a guarantee of "unbounded" in theory.
latency_unbounded_threshold_sec: 2.0

# --- Interpretation: collision-dominated regime ---
# When (sum of Collisions) / (sum of TX_Attempts) exceeds this ratio, we label as collision-dominated.
collision_dominated_ratio_threshold: 0.3

# --- Interpretation: retry exhaustion onset ---
# When (sum of RetriesExhausted) / (sum of Generated) exceeds this ratio, we label as retry exhaustion onset.
retry_exhaustion_onset_ratio_threshold: 0.05
