# Rule-based MAC selection (deterministic, explainable).
# Evaluation order matters: first match wins. No optimizer, no ML.
#
# Inputs: latency_sensitivity ("high"|"low"), node_count (int), offered_load ("low"|"medium"|"high" or numeric)

rules:
  - id: 1
    condition: "latency_sensitivity == \"high\""
    output: "MacTDMA"
    reason: "Latency critical -> bounded delay"

  - id: 2
    condition: "offered_load == \"high\""
    output: "MacTDMA"
    reason: "High load -> avoid contention"

  - id: 3
    condition: "node_count >= 9"
    output: "MacTDMA"
    reason: "Many nodes -> contention-based MACs degrade"

  - id: 4
    condition: "latency_sensitivity == \"low\" AND node_count <= 4 AND offered_load == \"low\""
    output: "MacCSMA"
    reason: "Low contention, relaxed latency"

  - id: 5
    condition: "latency_sensitivity == \"low\" AND node_count <= 8 AND offered_load == \"low or medium\""
    output: "MacCSMA_RTS"
    reason: "Moderate contention, hidden-node"

  - id: 6
    condition: "default"
    output: "MacTDMA"
    reason: "Default to deterministic MAC"
